#Anagrams Finder

So I was bored, and saw an amusing tweet which suggested using prime multiplication to the letters of each word to create an index of words with the same product - therefore anagrams.

As I said I was bored, and needed to brush up on some underutilized Python skills. So I wrote something which finds anagrams.

I'm sure there are many ways to improve it, so go ahead.
